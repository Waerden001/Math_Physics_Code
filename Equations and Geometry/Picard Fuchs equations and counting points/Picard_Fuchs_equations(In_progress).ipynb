It's not so clear from the counting-points point of way. For example, \"Heat\" is essentially described by the fact that the temperature in the future at a point is the average of temperature around that point now. Laplacian or the ajacency matrix essentially means \"taking the average\". Surely, it's hard to associate intuitive meaning to every differential equation, but for such ubiqutous Picard-Fuchs equation, shouldn't it have some intuition as simple as \"Heat\"? \n",
