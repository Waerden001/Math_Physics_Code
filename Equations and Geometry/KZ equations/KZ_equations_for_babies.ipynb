We write solutions as operators acting on special vectors in the representation, these vectors are actually special functions like spherical functions. See the Introduction to KZ equation paper above and think about how to fill the gap of simply writing something as a vector $v$ and a concrete special function(theta, modular forms, Legendre function, hypergeometric function, etc)."
