Packets are usually separated from each other by a special bit pattern, $01111110$, called a flag. If this special pattern appears within a packet, it could be interpreted as a flag indicating the end of the packet. To prevent this probleman extra binary digit of value 0 is inserted after each appearance of $011111$ in the original string (this can be deleted after reception). \n",
